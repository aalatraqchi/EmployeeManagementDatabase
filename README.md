# Employee Management System
## Overview
This project implements a SQL-based Employee Management System designed to manage employee records, track promotions, update salaries, and handle job history. It consists of multiple related tables: Employees, Departments, Salaries, and JobHistory. The system uses triggers to automatically update salaries when promotions are made. It is a very simple and straightforward project that I began just for practice and to review MySQL basics. It is just a small step to get me started so that I can further advance my skills in data management and data analysis.

## Features
